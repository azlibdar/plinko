# Plin*ko* 🐲

I wanted to recreate the magic of Plinko, even if it’s not perfect physics yet. This version is a fun experiment that shows how a ball interacts with the board. It’s not 100% realistic, but it’s close, and I plan to make it better over time.

This project is also a way for me to learn TypeScript and improve my coding skills. I hope you’ll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
